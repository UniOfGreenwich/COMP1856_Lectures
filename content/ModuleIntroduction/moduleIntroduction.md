## Module Aims

This course aims to familiarise [you] with approaches to effective management of the software development lifecycle, from the assessment of a project’s feasibility, through analysis, design, development, verification and validation. 

Not just concerned with the technical process of software production, this course aims to instil [you] with skills in software project management including the tools, methods and theories which support the engineering of software.

## Module Learning Outcomes 

On successful completion of this module a student will be able to:

[1] Identify appropriate software engineering methods for a given project.

[2] Demonstrate an understanding of the difference between software methods and their suitability to different software development projects.

[3] Demonstrate effective requirements engineering skills and an appreciation of their importance in the lifecycle of a software project.

[4] Clearly identify the means by which the outcomes of a software project can be verified and validated.

## Indicative Content

A range of software engineering topics including:

• Software Engineering Methods
• Feasibility Assessment
• Requirements Engineering
• Systems Design
• Verification and Validation

--- 


## Teaching and Learning Activities

The overall challenge will be to produce an item of software (examples such as a patient records database for a hospital, or an information retrieval program for a technical library). The example will involve a specification that is aimed to bring out the different aspects of the system design and development process. From specification changes to bugs on the original role out and changes in platform.
