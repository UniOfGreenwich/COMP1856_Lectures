## Classes

> **Classes** are software programming models - abstractions of the real world or system entities. 

- Classes have *state* and *behaviour*

- *Variables* are used to describe the state of the class and methods are used to describe behaviour

- Classes are collections of objects with common structure, common behaviour, common relationships and common semantics

- Objects belong to a particular class, objects are instances of a particular class 

---

## Classes & Objects (2)

- **Class**
  - a template that describes the data and behaviour associated with instances of that class
  - the basic building block of an object-oriented language such as C++, C#, Java, Kotlin etc.
  - classes are data types and can be used to create multiple objects

- **Object**
  - represents something with which we can interact with in a program
  - an objectâ€™s behaviour defines a collection of services that we can tell it to perform for us
  - a class is abstract and represents a concept, and an object represents an instance (realisation) of a class 

---

## Class - an Example

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

![h:500](../../figures/class_diagram.svg)

</div>

<div style="font-size:26px; margin-top:1px ">

```c#
class Module {
 string name;
 string code;
 int year;

 register(){

 }

 unregister(){

 }

}

```

</div>
<div>

---

## Objects


- An Object is an instance of a class and a group of objects for the same class have sepatate memory addresses. 
  
<div align=center>

![h:500](../../figures/class_diagram_2.svg)

</div>


---


## Abstraction

- Data abstraction is the process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information to the user.
Abstraction can be achieved with either `abstract` classes or `interfaces` 

- The `abstract` keyword is used for classes and methods:
  - Abstract class: is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class).

  - Abstract method: can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the derived class (inherited from).

---


## Inheritance

- Another class can inherit another classes functionality
- All methods, fields, variables, functions etc must be implemented and cannot be modified.
- Class can inherit only one abstract class.
- Optional implementation of abstract class internals.


---
## Example: Inheritance and abstraction 

```c#
abstract class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }

    public abstract void DisplayDetails();
}

class Student : Person
{
    public int StudentId { get; set; }

    // function and fields all must be implemented.
    public override void DisplayDetails()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Student: {Name}, Age: {Age}, Student ID: {StudentId}");
    }
}
```

---

## Interface

- Interface Class is like a header file in C
- It includes fields (setters,getters) and prototypes
- There is no body to any prototype, this is handled by the implementing class. 
- You still have to include all the "code" in the implementing function, but it does not have to action it. 

---


## Dependency Injection

- DI is a design pattern widely used in C# development for achieving Inversion of Control (IoC).

- In DI, dependencies of a class are provided from the outside, rather than the class creating its own dependencies.

---

## Key Concepts:

<div style="font-size:24px">

- **Inversion of Control (IoC):**

  - In IoC, control over object creation and management is shifted from the class itself to an external entity.

- **Dependency:**

  - A dependency is an object that another object relies on to accomplish its tasks.

- **Injection:**

  - Injection involves providing dependencies to a class from an external source.

- **Types of Dependency Injection in C#:**

   - Constructor Injection
   - Setter Injection
   - Interface Injection

</div>

---

## Example: Interface

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

```c#
// declare interface
interface IMyInterface {
  // prototypes
  void MyFuncton(int a, int b);public class Example
{
    // Static method
    public static void StaticMethod()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("This is a static method.");
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Accessing static method directly using the type
        Example.StaticMethod();
    }
}

```
</div>
<div>

```c#
class AnotherClass: IMyInterface {
  
   // can add some fuctionality here
  void MyFuction(int a,int b){
      Console.writeline(a*b);
  }
  
  
  void AnotherFunction(){
    
    Random rnd = new Random();

    for (int j = 0; j < 4; j++)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(rnd.Next());
    }
  }

}


```

</div>
</div>

--- 

## Example 2: 

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
<div style="margin-top:30px">

```c#
// Interface for items that can be picked up
public interface IItem
{
    void PickUp();
}

// Interface for the player character
public interface IPlayer
{
    void PickUpItem(IItem item);
}
```

</div>
<div>

```c#
// Implementation of an item that can be picked up
public class Coin : IItem
{
    public void PickUp()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Player picked up a coin!");
    }
}

// Implementation of the player character
public class Player : IPlayer
{
    public void PickUpItem(IItem item)
    {
        item.PickUp();
    }
}
```

</div>
</div>

---

## ... Example 2 ...

```c#
// Main game class
public class Game
{
    private readonly IPlayer player;

    // Constructor injection of player
    public Game(IPlayer player)
    {
        this.player = player;
    }

    // Game logic to simulate player interaction
    public void SimulateGame()
    {
        // Assume the player interacts with an item (coin) in the game world
        IItem item = new Coin(); // In a real game, this would come from the game world or level data
        player.PickUpItem(item);
    }
}
```

## Notes on `static` and `this`

- `static`
  - the `static` keyword is used to define members (fields, methods, properties, and events) that belong to a type itself, rather than to an instance of the type. This means that you can access static members directly through the type, without needing to create an instance of the type.
- `this`
  - whereas `this` is used to refer to the current instance and its instance-specific members. 

 ---

 ## `static` example

See the code snippet below, the `Example` class contains a single `static` method `StaticMethod()`. In the `Main` method of the Program class, we directly call the `StaticMethod()` without needing to create an instance of `Example` class.

<div style="font-size:26px">

```c#
public class Example
{
    // Static method
    public static void StaticMethod()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("This is a static method.");
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Accessing static method directly using the type
        Example.StaticMethod();
    }
}
```
</div>
