## Topics Covered

- Context models

- Interaction models

- Structural models

---

## System modelling

- Process of developing abstract models of a system, with each model presenting a different view or perspective of that system. 

- Representing a system using graphical notation, which is now almost always based on notations in the Unified Modelling Language (UML). 

- Helps the analyst to understand the functionality of the system and models are used to communicate with customers.
Software Modelling Object Approach

----

## Software Modelling Object Identification

- A **grammatical approach** based on a natural language description of the system – objects and attributes are nouns; operations or services are verbs. 

- The identification of **tangible things** in the application domain such as aircraft. 

- A **behavioural approach** and identify objects based on what participates in what behaviour such as managers manage.

- A **scenario-based analysis** the objects, attributes and methods in each scenario are identified. 

---

## System perspectives

- Different models can be developed to represent the system from different perspectives:

  - An external perspective, where you model the context or environment of the system.
  
  - An *interaction perspective*, where you model the interactions between a system and its environment, or between the components of a system.
  
  - A *structural perspective*, where you model the organisation of a system or the structure of the data that is processed by the system.
  
  - A *behavioural perspective*, where you model the dynamic behaviour of the system and how it responds to events. 

---

## UML diagram types

- **Activity diagrams**, which show the activities involved in a process or in data processing .

- **Use case diagrams**, which show the interactions between a system and its environment. 

- **Sequence diagrams**, which show interactions between actors and the system and between system components.

- **Class diagrams**, which show the object classes in the system and the associations between these classes.

- **State diagrams**, which show how the system reacts to internal and external events. 

Question: Why use graphical models?

---

## Use of graphical models

- As a means of facilitating discussion about an existing or proposed system
  - Incomplete and incorrect models are OK as their role is to support discussion.

- As a way of documenting an existing system
  - Models should be an accurate representation of the system but need not be complete.

- As a detailed system description that can be used to generate a system implementation
  - Models must be both correct and complete.

---

## Process perspective

- Context models simply show the other systems in the environment, not how the system being developed is used in that environment.

- Business Process models reveal how the system being developed is used in broader business processes.

- UML activity diagrams may be used to define business process models. They show the activities in a process and the flow of control from one activity to another

## Interaction models

- Modelling user interaction is important as it helps to identify user requirements. 

- Modelling *component interaction* helps us understand if a proposed system structure is likely to deliver the required system performance and dependability. 

- *Use case diagrams* – used to model the interactions between a system and external agents - human users or other systems

- *Sequence diagrams* – used to model interactions between system components

---

## Use case modeling

- A *use case* is a simple description of what a user expects from a system in the interaction

- Each use case represents a discrete task that involves external interaction with a system.

- As use cases give a simple overview of an interaction (represented by a verb), more detail needs to be added in the form of textual description, a structured description in a table, or a sequence diagram

- *Actors* in a use case may be people or other systems.
A use case is shown as an ellipse and the actors involved – as stick figures

## Sequence diagrams

- *Sequence diagrams* are part of the UML and are used to model the interactions between the actors and the objects within a system.

- A sequence diagram shows the sequence of interactions that take place during a particular use case or use case instance.


---

## Sequence diagrams

- The objects and actors involved are listed along the top of the diagram, with a dotted line drawn vertically from these

- Annotated arrows indicate interactions between objects

- The rectangle on the dotted line indicates the lifeline of the object concerned (the time that object instance is involved in the interaction)

- You read the sequence of interactions from top to bottom, left to right

- The annotations on the arrows indicate the calls to the objects, their parameters and the return values

- A box named “alt” is used with the conditions indicated in the square brackets, with alternative interaction options separated by a dotted line

## Difference between Activity and Sequence Diagrams

<details>
<summary>Question: What is the difference between Activity and Sequence Diagrams?</summary>

- They are both behavioural diagrams but have different emphases.

- **Activity diagram** is representing the control flowing from one activity to another, especially good at the logic of conditional structures, loops, concurrency.

- **Sequence diagram** is representing the sequence of messages flowing from one object to another, how their messages/events are exchanged in what time-order.

> Sequence diagram may also express conditions, loops and concurrency by using **alt** for example, but they are not as intuitive and convenient as those in activity diagram.

</details>

---

## Structural models

- **Structural models** of the software display the organization of a system in terms of the components that make up that system and their relationships. 

- Structural models may be **static models**, which show the structure of the system design, or **dynamic models**, which show the organization of the system when it is executing. 

- You create structural models of a system when you are discussing and designing the system architecture. 

---

## Class diagrams

- **Class diagrams** are used when developing an object-oriented system model to show the classes in a system and the associations between these classes. 

- A class can be thought of as a general definition of one kind of system object. 

- An **association** is a link between classes that indicates that there is some relationship between these classes. 

- When you are developing models, objects represent something in the real world, such as a patient, a prescription, a doctor, etc.
